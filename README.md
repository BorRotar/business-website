#Practice project

An example business website, built using React, EmailJS and Tailwind CSS.
All the pages are scalable.

The first page ("Vision") has a links to the third page ("Contact") and each link selects a different option from the contact form using the useState hook.

The "About" page is used to present different projects in a grid. You can hover over an image to reveal the text behind it. Under the grid there is an accordion menu where more information can be found.

The "Contact" page contains a form with input validation that is connected to an email address through EmailJS.
